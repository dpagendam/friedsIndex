\code{dataset_multiRep} is a dataset (matrix) containing synthetic, example data to demostrate the format that a data matrix should take when multiple (i.e. replicated) mixed mating cage experiments were used.
}
\details{
Each row  of the matrix contains data for each female recovered from a mating cage.  The three columns are: (i) "Cage" which contains an integer indicating which replicate cage the female came from; (ii) "NumEggs" which is the number of eggs laid by each female; and (iii) "NumViable" which is the number of eggs that hatched or produced viable offspring.
